# Supervised-learning-classification
Classification project


This project aims to predict whether passengers will recommend an airline to their friends using airline review data collected from 2006 to 2019. The dataset includes both multiple-choice and free-text responses. To achieve this, we will perform extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in the data. We will then implement various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests. The performance of these models will be evaluated to determine the most effective method for predicting passenger recommendations. The goal is to provide insights that airlines can use to improve customer satisfaction and referral rates.
